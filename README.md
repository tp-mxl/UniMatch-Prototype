> **⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: FRONTEND UI PROTOTYPE** > *Please note: This repository currently contains the **High-Fidelity Frontend UI Prototypes** for UniMatch. It consists of static HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The backend infrastructure, database, and matching algorithms are documented in our System Analysis and Design report and are slated for future development.*

## 📖 About the Project

UniMatch was designed to resolve critical inefficiencies that plague the student hiring process. Fragmented applicant data and the late, manual verification of academic credentials place a heavy administrative burden on universities and waste valuable resources for employers. 

UniMatch tackles this by establishing a high-integrity "trust chain." By merging verified, student-uploaded academic transcripts with public professional portfolios (LinkedIn/GitHub), we provide employers with a unified, reliable, and continuously updated talent pool—bypassing heavy institutional red tape.

## 🖥️ Interfaces Included in this Prototype

This repository contains the interface structures mapped out in our Information System Diagrams (ISDs), utilizing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) design pattern:

* **Authentication & Main Menu:** Landing page, login, and role-based routing.
* **Student Dashboard:** Profile setup, verified document uploads, job search filtering, and application tracking.
* **Employer Dashboard (Applicant Tracking):** Kanban-style pipeline, AI match breakdown cards, candidate filtering, and interview scheduling workflows.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Global moderation queue, user directory management, and system event logs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Prototype Phase)

* **Markup:** HTML5
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Custom variables, CSS Grid, Flexbox for responsive SaaS layouts)
* **Interactions:** Vanilla JavaScript (Tab switching, modal toggles, basic UI state)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Because this is a static frontend prototype, no build tools or servers are required to view the designs.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/unimatch-ui-prototype.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   `cd unimatch-ui-prototype`
3. **View the project:** Open any `.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., double-click `employer.html` or `admin-dashboard.html`).

## 🔮 Future Development Roadmap

This frontend prototype serves as the visual and interactive foundation for the full-stack UniMatch Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Our future implementation phases include:

### Phase 1: Backend Architecture
* Develop a stateless backend RESTful API using **Node.js / Express**.
* Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and stateless session management using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

### Phase 2: Database & Cloud Storage
* Set up a managed relational database (**PostgreSQL / MySQL**) to handle structured user profiles, relationships, and job postings.
* Integrate cloud object storage (**AWS S3 / Firebase**) for the secure hosting of student transcripts and resume PDFs.

### Phase 3: External Integrations & Security
* Integrate **OAuth 2.0** for seamless "Log in with LinkedIn/GitHub" functionality and automated portfolio syncing.
* Implement API-based malware scanning for all student-uploaded documents.

### Phase 4: Deployment
* Deploy the frontend application via Edge networks (**Vercel/Netlify**) and host the backend API on a scalable PaaS (**Render**).
